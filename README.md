# vision-zero-assortment
An assortment of tools that were used in vision zero related campaigns

## Goal

This is a mono repo of tools/scripts that were created to help with some Vision Zero related campaigns.

Most of the tools are a one-off type of deal, therefore the quality of the code/project is probably not optimal. However it did work for a campaign, and probably still has a few cool ideas that can be reused.
